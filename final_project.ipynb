        "## Price Information\n",
        "\n",
        "The first and most obvious limitation when purchasing real estate is the price. Ideally we would\n",
        "like to visualize price in a way that gives the user a sense of what homes nearby are valued. This\n",
        "data should be broken into smaller categories, possible city or zip code, to compare against other\n",
        "areas. Any visualizations\n",
        "that relate to price should first be filtered by the maximum price the user can afford. The ultimate\n",
        "end goal of the user may to be find a city, or zip code that matches their ideal price, or it may be\n",
        "to find a listing that is cheaper than others in in the local area. The goal of our visualization is\n",
        "to provide comparable price information for different areas and shows the similarities and\n",

        "* Price vs. Zestimate Scatter Plot\n",
        "    * Shows market stability and how the prices match the estimate\n",
        "    * Typically strongly correlated, but easy to find outliers\n",
        "* Price Density Plot\n",
        "    * Allows for quickly finding the average price\n",

        "prompted them to use the visualization and asked what problem they thought it solved. The answers\n",
        "varied, Some with technical knowledge did think that the solvable problem was to find the city with\n",

        "\n",
        "* Allow users to customize prices and number of beds/baths\n",

        "* Combine all data into one row of charts and keep same color scheme\n",

        "solutions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Build a heat map of prices by area\n",
        "    * Might be too complex\n",
        "* Classify houses by price and visualize them on a map\n",
        "    * Allow user to tune classification parameters\n",
        "* Build a visualization that allows the user to change the comparison parameters\n",
